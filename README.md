## :woman_technologist: About Me:

- I'm a nerd and I'm not afraid to admit it. I'm really enjoying my degree and am doing everything I can to expand my knowledge.
- In my free time you'll often find me learning a new skill - whether that be new programming lanaguage or a new craft - as I love learning and am up for any challenge.
- I’m a big fan of muscials and stage shows and before starting at Massey, I completed an Advance Associate Diploma in Teaching Speech and Drama. 
- I love tramping, so I am a sporty nerd, but I really love the comfort of my own home. 
- I’m a morning person and you’ll often see me in bed by 8pm reading a good book. 
- I do enjoy binge watching a good crime series while doing something like knitting, crocheting or a puzzle. I love spending time with family and friends hence I am also a people loving nerd! 
-  Below is my dog Poppy. She is my world and also my study buddy!
